# AI-CPCS331-MachineLearningProject
1.1. Introduce the topic of the report./n
Artificial intelligence affects the future of every industrial sector and every human being on this planet. It is the main engine of all emerging technologies such as 
mass data collection, robotics and the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence is expected to play a greater role in the coming years.
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating systems that learn - or improve performance - based on the data they 
consume. Artificial intelligence is a broad term that refers to systems or devices that simulate human intelligence. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are often 
discussed together, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but they don't mean the same thing. It is important here to mention that although all machine 
learning techniques are AI, not all AI is machine learning. In this report, we will show results for different algorithms on the same dataset with different software Weka, RapidMiner (2014)


1.2. Explain the disease selected for the project.


The disease selected for the project is liver disease. Liver disease refers to a 
range of conditions that impair the normal functioning of the liver. Common 
symptoms include fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and abdominal 
pain. The project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms, such as forest tree, 
naive Bayes, decision stump, and support vector machine, to analyze the Indian liver 
patient dataset. By comparing the accuracy of these algorithms, the project seeks to 
identify the most suitable algorithm for diagnosing liver disease based on the dataset's 
performance evaluation. (Liver Diseases, 2019)


1.3. Purpose of the project


This project aims to teach students the basics of machine learning while 
attempting to execute it in the simplest way possible. The primary focus was on 
separating the dataset into testing and training data. Aside from that, we hope to 
discover the relationship and impact of certain a group of different medical analyzes 
or variables on the outcome. As a result, we chose the Selector attribute as our label.


1.4. Outline approach


The approach followed to find the appropriate algorithms is as follows, first, 
we have chosen a dataset with clear behaviors and inputs such as age, gender, Total 
Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, ...etc., to reach the goal to be deduced which is whether 
the person has liver disease or not based on the data analyzed beforehand. Then we 
studied some ML algorithms whose uses match the specifications of the dataset and 
chose them for testing
